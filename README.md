Description

The Month Calendar project consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. It creates a visually appealing calendar interface that dynamically updates the dates based on the current month and highlights the current day.

The HTML file (index.html) sets up the basic structure of the calendar. It includes placeholders for the month name, current date, weekdays, and days of the month. It also links the CSS file (style.css) and JavaScript file (script.js) to provide styling and functionality.

The CSS file (style.css) defines the visual appearance of the calendar. It sets the background colors, font styles, dimensions, and positioning of the various calendar elements. The styling aims to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.

The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the dynamic generation of the calendar. It uses the JavaScript Date object to retrieve the current month, last day of the month, and first day of the month. Based on this information, it populates the calendar with the corresponding dates. It also applies a CSS class to highlight the current day.

Usage

To use the Month Calendar, follow these steps:

1. Download all the files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
2. lace the files in the same directory on your computer.
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The calendar will be displayed, showing the current month with the corresponding dates. The current day will be highlighted with a different background color. You can navigate through the months by updating the JavaScript code in script.js accordingly.

Feel free to modify the styling in the CSS file (style.css) to suit your preferences. You can customize the colors, fonts, and dimensions to create a calendar design that matches your needs.
